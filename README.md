# Redesign of the University Information System

This project was developed to address a real-world challenge faced by the University of Zenica's information system. The goal was to redesign the existing system to optimize its usability, functionality, and efficiency across various roles within the university. The redesign was executed using a user-centered design approach, ensuring an intuitive and seamless user experience through an iterative design process.

## Project Overview

By focusing on the specific needs of students, professors, administrative staff, and financial offices, this redesign aims to provide a solution that improves overall workflow, enhances communication, and streamlines university processes. The project followed a user-centered design approach, starting with a detailed analysis of the university's organizational structure and business processes. Through this analysis, we identified key roles and tasks that could benefit from system improvements. The redesign was conducted using Figma, applying modern UI/UX principles and an iterative design process to ensure optimal user experience.


## Research & Methodology

The project follows a structured development methodology that includes:
- Analysis of roles and tasks at the university
- Business process analysis to identify inefficiencies
- Market research and comparative analysis of similar information systems
- Surveying selected university roles to understand which functionalities are important to them, which they found easy and useful, and which they would like to see improved.
- Definition of functional requirements based on user needs
- UI/UX Design & Prototyping in Figma
- User testing & evaluation to refine interactions

## Project Access

The redesigned university information system is available on Figma, accessible directly via a web browser without the need for downloading or installing additional software. By clicking the link, you can explore the system's structure, functionalities, and interactive prototype elements.

[ðŸ”— Figma Prototype Link](https://www.figma.com/design/XWjpyes8glv5MxnXWYOVn5/Redizajn-korisni%C4%8Dkog-su%C4%8Delja-univerzitetskog-informacionog-sistema?node-id=6-3&t=AlG3GnsQw)

Within the Figma file, you can navigate through three key pages:

- Design Assets Library â€“ a collection of user interface resources, including typography, color palettes, iconography, and reusable components used throughout the system.
- Modules and Functionalities Overview â€“ an interactive display of all key user roles, their dashboards, and related system functions.
- Wireframe â€“ an overview of the basic structure and layout of the user interface elements, showcasing the information hierarchy and content organization within the system.
This structure provides a clear insight into the design and functionality of the redesigned university information system.

## Future Improvements

The current redesign serves as a foundation for continuous improvements, with some of the planned enhancements including:
- Development of a Mobile Application for on-the-go access.
- Integration with Learning Management Systems (LMS) to support online education.
- Advanced Data Analytics & AI Integration for predictive analytics in student performance.
- User Feedback-Driven Updates to refine features based on practical usage insights.

# Redesign of the University Information System

This project was developed to address a real-world challenge faced by the University of Zenica's information system. The goal was to redesign the existing system to optimize its usability, functionality, and efficiency across various roles within the university. The redesign was executed using a user-centered design approach, ensuring an intuitive and seamless user experience through an iterative design process.

## Project Overview

By focusing on the specific needs of students, professors, administrative staff, and financial offices, this redesign aims to provide a solution that improves overall workflow, enhances communication, and streamlines university processes. The project followed a user-centered design approach, starting with a detailed analysis of the university's organizational structure and business processes. Through this analysis, we identified key roles and tasks that could benefit from system improvements. The redesign was conducted using Figma, applying modern UI/UX principles and an iterative design process to ensure optimal user experience.


### User Roles

The system accommodates three primary user roles:

Student: Manages course enrollment, schedules exams, tracks academic progress, and accesses digital learning materials via Google Drive.

Professor: Handles course management, grading, research projects, and consultations, with integration of Google Calendar for scheduling and Google Forms for assessments.

Administrative Staff: Manages student records, enrollment processes, financial reports, and document verification.

### Research & Methodology

The project follows a structured development methodology that includes:

- Analysis of roles and tasks at the university

- Business process analysis to identify inefficiencies

- Market research and comparative analysis of similar information systems

- Surveying selected university roles to understand which functionalities are important to them, which they found easy and useful, and which they would like to see improved.

- Definition of functional requirements based on user needs

- UI/UX Design & Prototyping in Figma

- User testing & evaluation to refine interactions
